    /// (`frame_20260823_164053_757.png`, signature 3,400 / Lindinium): verified by direct
    /// OcrPipeline probe, not just visual inspection — a tighter, text-only crop at this same
    /// scale reads "3800" (Windows OCR confuses the HUD font's "4" for "8" without margin around
    /// the glyphs) or returns nothing; this rect's ~20px left/right and ~14px top/bottom margin
    /// around the digits is load-bearing, not slack to trim. The pin icon's densest column sits
    /// at x≈1264, this rect's left edge — a sliver of it is inside the crop, which does not stop
    /// OCR from reading cleanly.
    /// <para>
    /// The badge's measured center (x≈1281.5, ≈50.06% of 2560) matches a screen-centered locked-
    /// target reticle, which is why a fixed rect is plausible here at all — but that is inferred
    /// from this one frame, not confirmed across a scan where the target sits elsewhere on
    /// screen. If a future capture shows the badge off-center, this rect is calibrated to one
    /// camera angle, not a stable HUD element, and needs to be recalibrated. A wider reading
    /// (e.g. a six-digit cluster total) grows left toward the pin — the tighter margin — so watch
    /// that direction first if OCR starts missing again.

    /// <para>
    /// That warning has since come true, and this rect was too tight for five-digit cluster
    /// totals — recalibrated 2026-08-25 (see below) rather than widened, since the root cause was
    /// OCR channel/scale, not crop size.

    /// replay corpus currently has one four-digit frame, so add representative five- and six-digit
