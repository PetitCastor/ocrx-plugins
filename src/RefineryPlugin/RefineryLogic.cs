/// by name+quality, last-seen wins). The middle-column state header is classified every tick into a
/// <see cref="PanelState"/> and fed to a <see cref="PanelStateMachine"/>, so PROCESSING/COMPLETED are
/// captured without any rising-edge bookkeeping — an order already in progress or completed when the
/// tracker starts is picked up on the first clean frame, and the idempotent ledger merge means
/// repeated reads collapse. The COMPLETED panel's printed YIELD total is a checksum (within a
/// rounding tolerance): a matching row-sum marks the read <c>Complete</c>, otherwise <c>Partial</c>
