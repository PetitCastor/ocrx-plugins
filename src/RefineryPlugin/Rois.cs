/// The regions this plugin subscribes, in reference space. Static for the life of the process:
/// per-tick atomicity means every decision is made from one tick, so the set a tick can answer
/// must be complete before the tick arrives — there is no mid-tick round-trip to add a ROI.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Deliberate design change against the monolith: RefineryTracker gated its reads to save in-process
/// OCR — the Confirm-Delivery modal was only read when a panel was live (<c>needModal</c>), and
/// station/process/footer only on every 4th tick. Engine-side those reads cost about 1.3 ms each at
/// 2 Hz, which is not worth a gate, so the plugin subscribes the full set on every tick and the
/// header cadence is gone. Per-tick semantics are unchanged: everything still comes from one frame.
